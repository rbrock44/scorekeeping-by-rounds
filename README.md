# Scorekeeping By Rounds

This application was created to keep score of players or teams for any number of rounds.

This application does support having 2 screens of the webpage open at once. For example you could throw the 'Ranking' page on a different screen/monitor as the 'Score Entry' page and the 'Ranking' page will update the scores between 1-20 seconds of entering them.
